abstract = "Dimensionality reduction methods are widely used in information processing systems to better understand the underlying structures of datasets, and to improve the efficiency of algorithms for big data applications. Methods such as linear random projections have proven to be simple and highly efficient in this regard, however, there is limited theoretical and experimental analysis for nonlinear random projections. In this study, we review the theoretical framework for random projections and nonlinear rectified random projections, and introduce ensemble of nonlinear maximum random projections. We empirically evaluate the embedding performance on 3 commonly used natural datasets and compare with linear random projections and traditional techniques such as PCA, highlighting the superior generalization performance and stable embedding of the proposed method."
# abstract_short = "A mobile visual clothing search system is presented whereby a smart phone user can either choose a social networking image or capture a new photo of a person wearing clothing of interest and search for similar clothing in a large cloud-based ecommerce database. The phone's GPS location is used to re-rank results by retail store location, to inform the user of local stores where similar clothing items can be tried on."
